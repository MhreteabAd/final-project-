Sample Project: Blogging Platform
A comprehensive web application where users can register, log in, write blog posts,
comment, and manage their content.
Detailed Breakdown:
1. Project Initialization & Setup:
Start a new Node.js project using npm init .
Install required npm modules.
Establish a basic server with Express.js.
2. MongoDB Schema Design:
User Schema: Contains Username, Email, Hashed Password, Avatar, Timestamps.
Blog Post Schema: Houses Title, Content, Author references, Comments,
Timestamps.
3. Backend/API Development:
User Management: Routes for retrieving, registering, authenticating, updating,
and removing users.
Blog Post Management: Routes for displaying, creating, retrieving, editing, and
deleting blog posts.
4. Frontend Development:
Use EJS templates for Homepage, Registration, Login, Blog Creation, and Blog
Editing.
5. Testing with Postman:
Test each endpoint, ensuring expected responses for each request.
6. Additional Features & Modules:
Allow comments on posts.
Enable image uploads for user avatars or blog images.
7. Validation & Indexing:
Validate data with joi .
Index common search fields using mongoose .
8. Authentication & Authorization:
Use bcryptjs for password hashing.
Manage user sessions with express-session and connect-mongo .
Module-Based Breakdown:
1. MongoDB & Mongoose:
Define User and Blog Post schemas and models with mongoose.
Implement CRUD operations for both models.
Index frequent search fields. 
2. Express.js & EJS:
Define routes with Express.js.
Render dynamic views using EJS.
Handle form data with body-parser .
3. bcryptjs:
Implement email/password-based authentication.
Encrypt passwords using bcryptjs.
Handle user sessions with express-session and connect-mongo .
4. Node.js Core Modules:
Allow image uploads using path and fs .
Develop a custom module, imageHandler , for image-related functionalities.
5. Joi for Validation:
Validate form input data using Joi.
6. Postman for Testing:
Instruct students to test the API endpoints with Postman.
Expected Results:
1. Functional Web Application: A blogging platform where users can register, log
in, create/edit blog posts, and comment on posts.
2. Dynamic Web Pages: EJS-rendered views that display user-generated content,
including blog posts and comments.
3. Secure User Authentication: Safe registration and login processes with
encrypted passwords and session management. Enhanced user authentication using
Passport is optional .
4. Interactive API: Backend routes that respond dynamically to CRUD operations,
offering feedback on success or failure. Even if students opt not to use
Passport, robust authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) mechanisms
should be implemented.
5. Validated Inputs: All form inputs are validated for correct format and
sanitized before processing.
6. Optimized Database: Efficient data retrieval due to indexed fields in MongoDB.
7. Positive Testing Outcomes: Successful Postman tests for all API endpoints,
demonstrating correct responses and error handling.
